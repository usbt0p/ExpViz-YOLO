# Issues
- [x] Log scale is inverted, should be coarser at values closer to 0

- [x] Tooltip in epoch viz picks up too many datapoints, should pick only one at a time (this was a matter of adjusting the size of the invisible tooltip scatter)

- [ ] When clicking the legend to remove some of the plotted lines, the tooltip still appears we hovering over it (algthough it's invisible)

- [ ] Scale should auto-adjust dynamically depending on the minimum Y axis value from each series, and also when removing some of the plots by clicking the legend

- [ ] Add a new plot to represent the tradeoff between precision and recall

- [ ] The scripts should suport any model given the list/*.yaml files, not only ones of specific size, version, freezing strategy, etc.
